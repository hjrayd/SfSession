## What is it about ?
It's a website i've coded where teachers can manage sessions and trainings. They can add every element (module, sessions, trainees etc...) directly from forms that send the data into the database. <br>
They can also delete a module or a trainee directly from the session view. <br>
Every list and details of each elements is visible if we are logged in and can be consulted at any time. <br>
Teachers can register themselevs and then log in into the page. <br>
Some teachers can be admin and only them can add/delete elements. <br> 

## Tools i've used for this website :
