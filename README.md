## What is it about ?
It's a website i've coded in aprt of my training where teachers can manage sessions and trainings. They can add every element (module, sessions, trainees etc...) directly from forms that send the data into the database. <br>
They can also delete a module or a trainee directly from the session view. <br>
Every list and details of each elements is visible if we are logged in and can be consulted at any time. <br>
Teachers can register themselevs and then log in into the page. <br>
Some teachers can be admin and only them can add/delete elements. <br> 

## Tools i've used for this website :
